About midway through 2023, I had become thoroughly annoyed with TypeScript.
My constant tussles with the compiler assured me that using it for my projects was a recipe for
DX distaster.
For much of my time was spent in manually asserting types to resolve errors, which virtually defeated the purpose
of using TypeScript in the first place. When man and machine both block each other, there is little progress to be made.

But not more than a week ago, I stumbled upon a blog post which tried explaining the solution of a problem from the [Advent of TypeScript challenge](https://typehero.dev/challenge/day-23).
The "goal of the challenge" was to implement the game of Connect 4 in TypeScript and TypeScript only. This
meant that everything (any and all logic) was to be represented as types. That was when my brain,
like any other brain that considered TypeScript insufferable, imploded.

Even though I still do not understand much of it, I made it a point to appreciate the Turing Completeness of TypeScript's type system
and the magic of compilers. Hence, this is a gentle introduction to the nitty-gritty aspects of TS that has helped me rescue myself
from a barrage of squiggly red lines.

### Generics and Conditional Types

Generics are an ingenious concept in modern programming languages that help in creating flexible data types.
Strongly typed languages like Rust and TypeScript make use of generics to help increase their flexibility with
dynamic types while maintaining type-safety. This is made possible with the help of
constraints introduced around the type arguments.
The type system is inherently static, meaning that it only works at compile-time, not runtime. This is exactly
why certian properties like the length of Tuple types are accessible but not that of regular arrays. Tuples have
a predefined length at compile-time, unlike dynamic arrays. The compiler is able to infer most types at compile-time 
only. After all, all TS code is transpiled to JavaScript, which effectively erases all type enforcing,
before it is shipped to the browser. 

```typescript
function getCredentials<T>(password: T): T {
  return password;
}
```

This function does not have any constraints around the type T. Thus, it can accept any type without throwing an
error, while expecting to return a value of the same type.

```typescript
const getCredentials = <T>(password: T extends string | number): T => password

getCredentials("ilovets")
getCredentials(054321)
getCredentials(false) // error

```

The `extends` keyword in the above example performs further type-checking and puts constraints on the arguments
received by the generic. The password can now only be a string or a number type. Any other type would result in an error. In other
words, the type T must also be of type `(string | number)`. To understand this in a better way, let's look at
the following example.

```typescript
type Student = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  specialities: string[];
}; // type-alias

const student1: Student = {
  name: "swagatmitra",
  age: 20,
  specialities: ["crazy guitar skills"],
};

function studentInfo<T extends Student, P extends keyof T>(
  student: T,
  extra: P
): string {
  return `The student's name is ${student.name} and his ${String(
    extra
  )} is/are ${student[extra]}`;
}

studentInfo(student1, "specialities");
studentInfo(student1, "hobbies"); // error
studentInfo("swagatmitra", "age"); // error
```

The generic function now receives two type parameters, T and P. The type T is now constrained to be of type
`Student` while the P type has to be one of the properties of the T type. For a quick review, the `keyof` keyword
creates a `Union` of all keys in an object type. For instance,

```typescript
type args = keyof Student; // "name" | "age" | specialities
```

Please note the distinction between _types_ and _values_ in TypeScript. This is an extremely common pitfall
encountered by beginners. Generics only accept _types_ and not _values_, like most other operations in TypeScript
land. If we had to use a JavaScript value instead of a type,

```typescript
type args = keyof typeof student1;
```

since `typeof` extracts the type of the value, as inferred by the compiler.

On a similar note, if we had to performing the same check on an array (whether a value exists in an array), it
would require the application of trickier TypeScript knowledge.

```typescript
const specialities = ["crazy guitar skills", "good programmer"] as const;

function studentInfo<
  T extends Student,
  P extends (typeof specialities)[number]
>(student: T, speciality: P): string {
  return `The student's name is ${student.name} and his speciality is ${speciality}`;
}

studentInfo(student1, "good programmer");
studentInfo(student1, "great programmer"); // error
```

The is important to note the `as const` following the specialities array. For the sake of demonstration
(as you will see why), I am considering a fresh array instead of the array present in `student1`.
The `as const` phrase transforms the `specialities` array from `string[]` to a tuple of string literals. The
exact value of each element will be assigned as its type.

> `as const` converts the value into a type literally. Hence, TypeScript will only check for the exact
> value for a type or throw an error otherwise.

Finally, `(typeof specialities)[number]` or in general, `arrayType[number]` syntax is used to create a union
type of all elements in the array. Again, the type-checking will not work if the type of the array is a regular
`string[]` and not a literal type since `(typeof specialities)[number]` will not
be a union of the values present in the array.

```typescript
const a = ["hello", 2, "the world"];

type check1 = (typeof a)[number]; // string | number

const b = ["hello", 2, "the world"] as const;

type check2 = (typeof b)[number]; // "hello" | 2 | "the world"
```

We can use conditional checks using the ternary operator to create more complex types with logic.
The `never` type is useful when building conditionals as it allows us to enforce exhaustiveness
and account for all possible types. You can think of the `never` type as the null set (from set theory).
In TypeScript land, it signifies a value that cannot exist. Hence, it is used to remove or discard certain types
that do not match our condition. The following example demonstrates this.

```typescript
type filter<T, P> = T extends keyof P ? T : never;

type check1 = filter<"age" | "name" | "degree" | "gpa", Student>; // "age" | "name"
```

This brings us to our next topic.

### Mapped Types

Mapped types are used to manipulate existing object types. The `in` keyword helps iterate through the keys
of the target type. To understand this better, let's say we want to extract the key-value pairs in _Student_
without string values.

```typescript
type Mapped<T> = {
  [K in keyof T]: T[K] extends string ? never : K;
};

// type StudentMapped = Mapped<Student>
// {
//     name: never,
//     age: "age",
//     specialities: "specialities"
// }
```

The `[K in keyof T]` syntax loops through the object type T with its keys being assigned the type parameter K
each iteration. And much like regular JavaScript object indexing, the `T[K]` signifies the type of the value
associated with the key K.

```typescript
type ExtractKeys<T> = Mapped<T>[keyof T];

// type StudentExtractKeys = ExtractKeys<Student> // "age" | "specialities"
```

In the `ExtractKeys` type, we are creating a union of the keys without `never` values in the previously built
mapped type. The `[keyof T]` is used to index and extract keys which do not have a `never` type as a value,
in this case, the keys without `string` types.

```typescript
type FinalType<T> = {
  [K in ExtractKeys<T>]: T[K];
};

type NoString = FinalType<Student>;

// {
//     age: number,
//     specialities: string[]
// }
```

The `FinalType` is a mapped type of all the values present in the `ExtractKeys` generic as keys with their
corresponding values in type T.

### Infer

The `infer` keyword is used to isolate a type inside a conditional for later use. A classic example of the
infer is present in the in-built ReturnType utility type provided by TypeScript.

```typescript
function helper(a: number, b: string) {
  return a + b;
}

type CustomReturnType<T> = T extends (...args: any[]) => infer R ? R : never;

type checkReturnType = CustomReturnType<typeof helper>; // string
```

The `(...args: any[]) => infer R ? R : never` syntax checks whether the type T is a function, and if it is,
we isolate the return type of the function using `infer R` and use it accordingly in our conditional branch.
It is important to note that the `infer` declarations are only allowed in the extends clause of the conditional.
Similarly, we can use it to get the type of arguments passed into a function.

```typescript
type CustomArgType<T> = T extends (...args: infer R) => any ? R : never;
```

Here is another cool example using infer.

```typescript
const student1 = {
  name: "swagatmitra",
  age: 20,
  specialities: ["crazy guitar skills"],
} as const;

type InferPrefix<T> = {
  [K in keyof T]: T[K] extends `${infer R}atmitra` ? R : never;
};

type checkInferPrefix = InferPrefix<typeof student1>[keyof typeof student1]; // swag
```

### Conclusion

Advanced TypeScript can be an utter mess to deal with. When recursive types and complex chained conditionals
make you want to pull your hair out, know that it is not worth screwing your head over when you can
always settle for JSDoc or write a web server in plain C. But I hope this helps you in deciphering the clutter
inside TypeScript libraries if you ever plan on building one of your own.

As for me, I'll probably just stick to my type.
