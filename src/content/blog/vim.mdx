Nothing beats the dissatisfaction of not being able to get faster at something you enjoy doing.
Knowing very well that increasing your pace will drastically improve your competence. That was me before I
experienced the magic of using Vim motions. And now, almost a month later, I can't live without it.
Being a Vim wizard comes at a cost, apparently.

If you're not already aware, Vim is a text-editor which is based on _The keyboard is all you need_ philosophy.
It employs an ingenious technique (referred to as motions) which allows users to move around and edit a block of text without the
need of a mouse.
Now, it is not necessary for you to use Vim as your text-editor to learn Vim motions. You can use any editor
of your choice which provides support for a Vim plugin. If you're using VSCode, you need to install the Vim
extension.

I consider touch typing to be an invaluable skill for people like me who find themselves fiddling with computers
for a good portion of the day. While touch typing allows you to _type_ at the speed you think, Vim empowers
you to _edit_ your text at the same speed. This has turned out to be a complete gamechanger in terms of boosting
efficiency.

> Vim may not be productive for you if you do not touch type. A strong muscle memory is crucial for building
> up speed and effectiveness.

### Modes

This is achieved by switching between the various modes that Vim offers.
The most important ones are -

1. <span style="color: bisque;">Normal Mode</span>

   This is the default mode in Vim,
   which enables the user to navigate through the document, primarily by using the home row keys of `j`, `k`
   `l` and `k` for moving down, up, right and left respectively. Other keys such as `w` (also `e`) or `b` for
   moving forward and backwards by a word, `{` and `}` for moving up and down empty lines, etc. make it super
   easy to jump from one line to another. This mode is special since other editing modes can be entered only
   through the Normal Mode. The `Esc` key is reserved by default to enter Normal Mode from other modes.

2. <span style="color: bisque">Insert Mode</span>

   The Insert Mode is where Vim behaves like any other text editor by allowing us to input text.
   We can enter it by pressing `i` or `a`.

3. <span style="color: bisque">Visual Mode</span>

   To remove the need of selecting a block of text by holding down the mouse as we're usually familiar with,
   Vim has the Visual Mode. It essentially has two important forms, the Character Visual Mode (`v`)
   and the Line Visual Mode (`V`). The former allows the flexibility to choose every character starting from
   the current cursor postition while the latter selects each line. The `o` key allows our cursor to move
   from one end of the selected block to the other.

4. <span style="color: bisque">Command Mode</span>{" "}

   This mode is reserved for entering commands in the Vim editor's command line. This can be entered by
   pressing `:` or `/` to perform certain tasks like saving the file (`:w`), quitting (`:q`), or perform 
   search (`/word`) and replace (`:%s/old/new`) operations. Vim has plenty of other commands which are not
   very useful if you're not working on the actual Vim editor.

### The Grammar

In my opinion, Vim is no different than a language. It has a formal system of _nouns_,
_verbs_ and _movements_ that combine together to create motions. Nouns are targets (words, paragraphs, etc.)
against which we perform a particular action (verb), like cutting/deleting or inserting text.
The nouns include -

1. w (word)
2. p (paragraph)
3. s (sentence)
4. ( (also b for parentheses)
5. \{ (also B for curly braces)
6. " (double quotes)
7. [ (square brackets)
8. ` (back ticks)
9. t (HTML tags)

And the verbs include -

1. d (delete)
2. c (change)
3. y (yank or copy)
4. v (select)

Some text object movements are -

1. i (inside)
2. a (around)
3. t (till character)
4. f (to character)
5. T (till character backwards)
6. F (to character backwards)

#### Compounding Motions

### Macros

Macros are an incredible feature, if implemented correctly. They consist of a pre-recorded set of movements
which can be used to perform repetitive tasks. Like appending a specific phrase on every
line or inserting line-breaks after a definite interval of characters. It works by mapping a key to the
recorded movement which can be called later and re-used throughout the document.

To start recording a macro (in Normal Mode), we press the `q` key followed by any key of our choice (say `e`) as
the key we want to map our macro to. Once we execute that, we will notice a

> Recording @e

message on the command line of our editor. From this point onwards, every keystroke we make will be recorded as a
macro-move till we press the `q` key again to end the recording. To utilize or call this macro, we need to
press the `@` key followed by the key we mapped our macro to, in our case `e`. This will modify the document
from our current cursor postition in the order of the recorded keystrokes.

### Tricks

### Conclusion

Vim motions have been unreasonably impactful in the way I write code. The only downside of _Vim-ing hard_ is it
induces a subtle restlessness in your fingers once you get too used to it. One that doesn't wear off easily.
Maybe taking it slow will save you the feeling of losing your phalanges when slicing through sentences, or
maybe it's just unique to me. I haven't a clue. But nevertheless, I've loved very single minute I've Vim-med
and there's just no going back.
