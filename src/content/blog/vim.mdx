Nothing beats the dissatisfaction of not being able to get faster at something you enjoy doing.
Knowing very well that increasing your pace will drastically improve your competence. That was me before I
experienced the magic of using Vim motions. And now, almost a month later, I can't live without it.
Being a Vim wizard comes at a cost, apparently.

If you're not already aware, Vim is a text-editor which is based on _The keyboard is all you need_ philosophy.
It employs an ingenious technique (referred to as motions) which allows users to move around and edit a block of text without the
need of a mouse.
Now, it is not necessary for you to use Vim as your text-editor to learn Vim motions. You can use any editor
of your choice which provides support for a Vim plugin. If you're using VSCode, you need to install the Vim
extension.

I consider touch typing to be an invaluable skill for people like me who find themselves fiddling with computers
for a good portion of the day. While touch typing allows you to _type_ at the speed you think, Vim empowers
you to _edit_ your text at the same speed. This has turned out to be a complete gamechanger in terms of boosting
efficiency. I don't intend this to be a Vim tutorial but rather a guide to understand Vim as a language. I will
not be going over commands which do not contribute towards our objective.

> up speed and effectiveness.

### Modes

This is achieved by switching between the various modes that Vim offers.
The most important ones are -

1. <span style="color: bisque;">Normal Mode</span>

   This is the default mode in Vim,
   which enables the user to navigate through the document, primarily by using the home row keys of `j`, `k`
   `l` and `k` for moving down, up, right and left respectively. Other keys such as `w` (also `e`) or `b` for
   moving forward and backwards by a word, `{` and `}` for moving up and down empty lines, etc. make it super
   easy to jump from one line to another (These are called _movements_ and are discussed later). This mode is special since other editing modes can be entered only
   through the Normal Mode. The `Esc` key is reserved by default to enter Normal Mode from other modes.

2. <span style="color: bisque">Insert Mode</span>

   The Insert Mode is where Vim behaves like any other text editor by allowing us to input text.
   We can enter it by pressing `i` (inserts to the left of current position) or `a` (inserts to the right of
   current position).

3. <span style="color: bisque">Visual Mode</span>

   To remove the need of selecting a block of text by holding down the mouse as we're usually familiar with,
   Vim has the Visual Mode. It essentially has two important forms, the Character Visual Mode (`v`)
   and the Line Visual Mode (`V`). The former allows the flexibility to choose every character starting from
   the current cursor postition while the latter selects each line. The `o` key allows our cursor to move
   from one end of the selected block to the other.

4. <span style="color: bisque">Command Mode</span>{" "}

   This mode is reserved for entering commands in the Vim editor's command line. This can be entered by
   pressing `:` or `/` to perform certain tasks like saving the file (`:w`), quitting (`:q`), or perform
   search (`/word`) and replace (`:%s/old/new`) operations. Vim has plenty of other commands which are not
   very useful if you're not working on the actual Vim editor.

Additional modes like Replace or Terminal also exist, but they've been of little practical use for me as far as
Vim motions are concerned.

### The Grammar

Vim is no different than a language. It has a formal system of _nouns_,
_verbs_ and _movements_ that combine together to create motions. Nouns are targets (words, paragraphs, etc.)
against which we perform a particular action (verb), like copying/deleting or pasting text.

_Movements_ include all keys that are used to move the cursor around in Normal Mode. These include the home-row keys
(`j`, `k`, `h`, `l`), word-movement keys (`w`, `e`, `b`), line-movement keys -

1. `0` move to start of line
2. `$` move to the end of line
3. `gg` move to the first line of file
4. `G` move to the last line of file
5. `(` move backwards to the start of each sentence
6. `)` move forwards to the start of each sentence

and 4 special movement keys -

1. t (till character)
2. f (to character)
3. T (till character backwards)
4. F (to character backwards)

These special movements require a second argument as their target character.

```
(special-movement)(character)
```

For example, `ti` moves the cursor forward to the position before the first occurence of the character `i` in the
current line. Similarly, `Fg` moves the cursor backwards to the position of the first occurence of the chracter
`g` in the current line.

The nouns include -

1. w (word)
2. p (paragraph)
3. s (sentence)
4. ( (also b for parentheses)
5. \{ (also B for curly braces)
6. " (double quotes)
7. [ (square brackets)
8. ` (back ticks)
9. t (HTML tags)

There are four verbs.

1. d (delete)
2. c (change)
3. y (yank or copy)
4. v (select)

The _Delete_ and _Change_ verbs have only one distinction. _Delete_ removes a noun and preserves
the Normal mode while _Change_ removes a Noun and enters Insert Mode.

We can combine a _noun_ and a _verb_ or a _noun_ and a _movement_ together to execute a motion. For example,
`dw` (delete a word when cursor is in the beginning) becomes a _verb + noun_ motion whereas `de` (delete
everything from current cursor position to the end of word) is a _verb + movement_ motion. You can substitute
any verb with a noun/movement to carry out an action. You can also include a number after the verb to specify
the length of characters or lines that will be modified by the action. For example, `d4j` (verb + count + movement)
deletes 4 lines down from the current cursor position, since `j` is the downwards movement key.

We can create motions with special-movements in the following structure.

```
(verb){count}(special-movement)(character)
```

- `dt.` delete everything from current cursor postition till the first occurence of a `.`
- `vfo` select everything from current cursor position to the first occurence of a `o`
- `yF-` copy/yank everything _backwards_ from current cursor position to the first occurence of a `-`
- `d3fy` delete everything from current cursor postition till the first 3 occurences of `y`

For general movements, the structure is -

```
(verb){count}(noun/movement)
```

If you've tried out the above formula, you may have noticed that not all nouns (infact, every noun besides `w`)
produce motions with verbs. This is because nouns are a little special and require the addition of, what I like
to call a warp-specifier, to help edit our text with greater accuracy.

#### Compounding Motions using warp-specifiers

Good things come in pairs, so do warp-specifiers.

1. i (inside)
2. a (around)

The `i` specifier is used to instruct the verb to perform the action inside the noun, while
`a` is used to perform the action around it. It usually follows the given structure.

```
(verb){count}(specifier)(noun)
```

Here are a few examples.

- `daw` _deletes_ the _current word_ from any cursor position along with the adjacent space, hence _around_.
- `ciw` _changes_ (deletes and inserts) the _current word_ from any cursor position without removing the
  spaces, hence _inside_.
- `dab` _deletes around_ a pair of _parentheses_ (b also means ()), resulting in the removal of everything
  inside the braces along with the braces itself.
- `yip` _yanks/copies inside_ the current _paragraph_, resulting a in block of text without its surrounding
  line-breaks.
- `v3as` _selects around three sentences_ to the right including the current sentence, along with a trailing space.

### Macros

Macros are an incredible feature, if implemented correctly. While they cannot be considered a part of Vim motions,
they increase your productivity tenfolds in certain situations. They consist of a pre-recorded set of movements
which can be used to perform repetitive tasks. Like appending a specific phrase on every
line or inserting line-breaks after a definite interval of characters. It works by mapping a key to the
recorded movement which can be called later and re-used throughout the document.

To start recording a macro (in Normal Mode), we press the `q` key followed by any key of our choice (say `e`) as
the key we want to map our macro to. Once we execute that, we will notice

> Recording @e

on the command line of our editor. From this point onwards, every keystroke we make will be recorded as a
macro-move till we press the `q` key again to end the recording. To utilize or call this macro, we need to
press the `@` key followed by the key we mapped our macro to, in our case `e`. This will modify the document
from our current cursor postition in the order of the recorded keystrokes.

### Tricks

Now that you've gained the intuition behind Vim motions, I'll be sharing a few of my favourite Vim motions.

1. This is one I use a lot. `I` and `A`. They move your cursor to the beginning and end of the current line
   respectively. Simple and super useful, believe me.

2. If you need to jump to a word that's a few words down the line, but don't want to bother having to hold
   down `w` or `e`, fret not. Simply `/word`, hit enter and you'll be teleported to the first character of the
   word in your current line, even if the same word exists multiple times in the document. In most cases, you don't
   have to match the entire word either.

3. `cc` to delete and insert in the current line.

4. Nobody likes using `d0` to delete from the current cursor position till the end of line. Instead, use
   the simple `D`

5. `bi` to insert infront of the current word and `ea` to insert behind it. Priceless move.

6. To replace a character without having to go to insert mode, press `r` over the character you want
   to replace followed by the new character.

7. Now this is exclusively a coding example. If you're on a variable and need to find the line where it was
   defined, press `gd` over the word and your cursor will instantly jump to the desired line.

Since I stated previously that this is not a Vim tutorial, I compiled a non-exhaustive list of useful Vim commands
in this [Github Repository](). You can check them out if you like :)

### Conclusion

Vim motions have been unreasonably impactful in the way I write code. The only downside of _Vim-ing hard_ is it
induces a subtle restlessness in your fingers once you get too used to it. One that doesn't wear off easily.
Maybe taking it slow will save you the feeling of losing your phalanges when slicing through sentences, or
maybe it's just unique to me. I haven't a clue. But nevertheless, I've loved very single minute I've Vim-med
and there's just no going back.
And as always, Vim on!
