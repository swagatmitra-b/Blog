_Back in 2020, on my 16th July, I had an epiphany that radically changed everything I knew about music._

The wreck that had been the year proved too harsh for my freshly graduated ass. I despised online school, owned
a miserable journal and did everything humanely possible to quell a burgeoning crisis borne of social isolation
and brutal introspection. And unsurprisingly enough, I resorted to binge-watching.
A splendid curse of the modern human. I was sat on my living room futon, watching
[anime](https://myanimelist.net/anime/41168/Nakitai_Watashi_wa_Neko_wo_Kaburu) from a laptop
that had been overexposed to the internet in the weeks prior. While my mind refused being sucked into the
romance that had been simmering since the start, it wasn't until the _yandere_ drama poured out
into a heartfelt scene between the two protagonists when a quiet guitar tune started playing in the background.
And before long, the exquisiteness of the female voice that followed, blended with my emotional vulnerability and blew away the
roof of our tiny apartment.

### The horror of auditioning

To say I was awestruck would be an understatement. I spent the rest of the evening researching about
the musicians responsible for weilding such extraordinary magic. About Yorushika, the Japanese duo
who had taken hostage to my senses. As it would happen, I came across a song from their debut album called
`言って。(Itte)`, written from the perspective of a lover in the wake of the devastating loss of her
counterpart. The gut remorse and guilt from one's incapacity to change the course of reality rises to a cry
in the final refrain of the song. I knew I had never felt so captured and sentimentally bogged down by an electric guitar
and a voice before. I never knew the price of your selfish death paid by the ones you leave behind. The
distraught, paralyzed souls of your loved ones who are doomed to a lifetime of irredeemable loss. That our thoughts
and actions bore consequences no matter how useless we might feel and that's exactly why we need to make the best
of what we have. Every day until the end.

### Congregation for recreational purposes

I didn't speak Japanese. I could listen to their songs without a hint of understanding and still not feel
foolish. I liked them for what they made me feel and I didn't care.

I now had a weakness for upbeat pop-rock sounds and soulful vocals that swelled me like drugs. The powerful guitar riffs that
is a characteristic in many of their songs had upset my mental chemistry. I felt happier and forgiving. I could plug in my
headphones, detach from this universe and return better than I had hoped to be in months.
I had successfully deceived myself into a healthier state of being and there could be no qualms about it.

But as time progressed, a mix of maturity and subtle curiosity advised me to go through the trouble of
reading translations to truly acknowledge their words. I discovered that much of their work has been inspired by
literature and explores profound experiences relating to the human condition. Their paired well with the duo's
anonymity, which in my opinion, helps keep their work pure and enigmatic. I do not like to indulge in a critical
study of an artist's work for I am neither qualified, nor especially enthusiastic about it.

- `斜陽 (Setting Sun)` */}

I still don't speak Japanese. Maybe if I did, I would have a more lucid view of the picture Yorushika is
trying to paint. But if that were to happen, I'd also lose the naive canvas that I painted through their songs.
Translations are only as good as the translator. While I may never be able to deeply appreciate their genius
poetry, their music has left nothing that owes an explanation. 

### That's why I gave up on music

If there is one thing about being human which I regard the most precious, that would be the beauty
of perceiving music. When your favourite songs liberate you from your cataclysm and leave you feeling
unfettered and limitless, you bloom into someone you're proud of being. There may be times when you feel burdened
by responsibilities and spend sleepless nights in the shadows of unfounded fears concerning your
future. Times when everything seems to head south. In those moments, when giving up on life presents itself to be
an easy choice, you seek refuge in music. Unable to give up on what keeps breathing you back to life and pushing
you beyond what you were capable of. Because you never can.
